# firebasewithReact
A very basic app with signin/signup functionality using firebase and saving user's data to firebase.

Clone this app and go to the app directory and then run 'npm install', it will download all the required dependencies. You also have to change firebase information in the app and then on running 'npm start' you can see the app.
